Overview of Project ☁️

I built an image labels generator using Amazon Rekognition. Once completed, it recognized objects in my photos and labeled them (for example, a photo of a cat was labeled “Cat”).

Steps I Performed 👩‍💻

I created an Amazon S3 bucket.

I uploaded images to the S3 bucket.

I installed and configured the AWS CLI.

I imported the required Python libraries.

I added the detect_labels function.

I added the main function.

I ran my Python file and reviewed the results.

Services I Used 🛠

Amazon S3: I used it to store the images I wanted to label.

Amazon Rekognition: I used it to analyze images and generate labels (and bounding boxes when available).

AWS CLI: I used it to interact with AWS services from my terminal.
